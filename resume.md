Python is an interpreted language.  

A PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) is a design document that provides information to the Python community or describes new features, processes, or environment changes for Python. It is similar to PHP PSRs. 

Python as a **language** is just a specification that defines a set of rules and grammar for writing python code.
Python as a **implementation** is a program that understands those rules and can execute python code.  
The default implementation is called "CPython", which is a program written in C, but there are some other implementations.
