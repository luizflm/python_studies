# Resume
Python is an interpreted language.  

Python as a **language** is just a specification that defines a set of rules and grammar for writing python code.  
Python as a **implementation** is a program that understands those rules and can execute python code.  
The default implementation is called "CPython", which is a program written in C, but there are some other implementations like: Jython, IronPython, etc.

# PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal)
A **PEP**  is a design document that provides information to the Python community or describes new features, processes, or environment changes for Python. It is similar to PHP PSRs. 

# How Python code is executed?
When we run a python program using CPython, first it will compile the python code into python bytecode. Then, it will pass that bytecode to Python Virtual Machine which will in turn convert it into machine code and execute it.
